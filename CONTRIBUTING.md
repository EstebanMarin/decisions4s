# Contributing

For now, the best way to contribute is to model your use case and contribute that as an example in the `examples`
project. You will most likely hit some issues or limitations. If you can't solve those, come to our Discord server and
let's discuss!

This exercise will give you a good opportunity to try the library. Once done, please share your feedback!
